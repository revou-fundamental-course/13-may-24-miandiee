            <strong>Sum of Angles is Always 180 Degrees</strong>
            <p class="text-slider">
              No matter the shape or size of a triangle, the sum of its internal
              angles will always equal 180 degrees. This property is fundamental
              in Euclidean geometry. It applies to all types of triangles:
              equilateral, isosceles, and scalene.

            <strong>Triangles are the Strongest Shape</strong>
            <p class="text-slider">
              Triangles are incredibly strong and stable shapes because any
              added force is evenly distributed across all three sides. This
              property is why they are often used in construction and
              engineering, such as in bridges and roof trusses.

            <p class="text-slider">
              Triangles are commonly used in art and architecture due to their
              aesthetic appeal and structural stability. For example, the
              Pyramids of Egypt are based on triangular shapes, which provide a
              stable structure that has lasted for thousands of years.

              Triangles can also be found in nature. For example, the triangular
              shape of certain leaves and the way honeycombs are constructed
              (hexagons can be divided into triangles) utilize the strength and
              efficiency of this shape.

              mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and

              This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides
              of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining
              side. This property helps determine whether a set of three lines
              can form a triangle.

                Triangles are widely used in architectural structures due to
                their stability and strength. From the triangular trusses in
                roof designs to the triangular supports in bridges, the
